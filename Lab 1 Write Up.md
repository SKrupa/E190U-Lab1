#Introduction
In this lab we constructed the hardware for a standard video game console controller. The design specifications demanded at least two analog joysticks, 4 buttons, and a switch. these could be configured in anyway the designer wished, provided that the final design was functional as a controller.

#Design Methodology
Since mainstream video game controllers have been converging on a fairly uniform profile with most controllers having a similar amount of buttons and joysticks, I decided to model my design after this standard design. I felt that working off of tried and tested designs for a first controller would be more successful than abandoning years of knowledge present in the industry.

Specifically, I modeled the layout of the xBox One and xBox 360 controllers. I personally find these to be the most comfortable controllers to hold. I did make one deviation, which was to make the controller larger than both of these reference controllers. Part of this was because of design limitations, the joysticks and microcontroller we were provided were bulky and in order to fit them on the controller, the controller would need to be physically fairly wide. But I also feel like modern controllers have not kept up with the trend of gamer's getting older. While video game consoles and their controllers were initially marketed towards children, which waranted the small size of the controller, modern consoles need to appeal to both children as well as adults. For this reason, I chose to create a larger controller to allow individuals with larger hands to comfortably hold the controller.



The button layout is exactly the same as the standard xBox layout, with diagonally placed analog sticks. I contemplated switching the locations of the right face buttons and the right joystick (as can be seen on the Wii pro controller). However since I had already constructed the left half of the controller, I found that using the directional pad (d-pad) was pretty uncomfortable due to the controllers size. Jumping from the analog stick to the d-pad required a lot of effort, this is not a problem with the left side of the controller since one rarely switched between an analog stick and a d-pad mid-game, but would be an issue when trying to quickly jump between aiming with the right stick and perfomring an action with the face buttons.
